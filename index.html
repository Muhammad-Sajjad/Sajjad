            <p class="rightclear">I started learning code when I was 15 years old because I wanted to make my own video game. it took just one year to learn everything I needed to know programming and web development in order to start to work in this field and now I can so many things – from creating websites to WordPress themes and plugins. It’s everything I needed to start the career of my dreams. And I’m still learning more about the field every day since technology is always changing and there’s always something new to learn.</p>

            <h3 class="leftclear">Music</h3>
            <p class="leftclear">I started playing guitar when I was like twenty, twenty-one and I was in a band where I had two guitars that were just great and it really didn’t matter to me, I really was a non-existent force in the guitar world." Over time, he pointed out, "I’ve always totally surrounded myself with really accomplished guitarists, there was no reason for me to play. So I wish I would’ve continued on guitar, but I spent much more time on the lyrics and the character. So, to me, I was a bit of a quitter.</p>
